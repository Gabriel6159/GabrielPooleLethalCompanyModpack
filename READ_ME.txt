Find the lethal company folder (Steam -> Lethal Company -> Manage -> Browse local files)
Put the bepinex folder's contents into the lethal company folder 
then run the game until it asks you to choose online or lan
close the game
go back to the lethal company files
place everything in the forConfig in the folder labeled "config", which is in a folder called bepinex in your game files
place everything in the forPlugins folder in the folder labeled "plugins", also in the bepinex folder
open the config file for HDcompany and adjust as needed (at least pick correct resolution)
open the FPV camera config file and adjust as needed (20fps, second best quality for feed should work well)
EDIT
in the Evaisa-HookGenPatcher-0.0.5 folder, 
  -there is a file in a folder called 'config', that goes in your folder 'config' 
  -also in a folder called 'patchers' there is a folder that goes in your folder inside of the bepinex folder of the same name
